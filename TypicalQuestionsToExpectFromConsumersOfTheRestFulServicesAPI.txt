Typical Questions To Expect From Consumers Of The Rest FulServices:-

- What is the URL to use to access the service?
- What is the format of the request?
- What is the format of the response?
- Are there any validations?
- Should we adhere to any constraints?

So the consumer would want to know how to use the APIs or the services that we are creating.

How to provide that information to your consumers?
This is where you have to document your RestAPIs.

First Option is to manually document your API using Word or HTML page.
e.g you would document like this.
The URL to access all users is this "and you write your URL here".
And in the response you can get "mention the parameters that may be returned".

Another option is to use Swagger.
